## Humble Data at College of DuPage

Saturday 11 October 2025 at College of DuPage, Glen Ellyn, IL, United States

### Learn Python for Data Science in this Beginners' Workshop
Would you like to learn to code but don't know where to start? Taking your first steps in programming can seem like an impossible task, so we've decided to put on a workshop to show beginners how it can be done and share our passion for the world of data science!

"We want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you." – Python Software Foundation's Diversity Statement

We invite those from under-represented groups in data to apply to join us at our Humble Data workshop, a free event **at College of DuPage in Glen Ellyn on Saturday, 11 October 2025**.

In this workshop, you will learn the basics of programming in Python, as well as how to use tools such as Jupyter notebooks to analyse data.

You will be learning in small groups, each with an assigned mentor to guide you through the workshop materials and answer your questions. You can expect plenty of exercises, as well as inspiring talks from those who were once in your shoes.

**HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?**

This workshop is being run by the Data Science and AI Lab leadership who are dedicated to the spirit of open source. Every day we benefit from the hard work of others when we use free open tools. This is our way of giving back.

### Why Humble Data?

There are many reasons for people to push aside their hopes of a tech career, we're here to listen, to understand what makes it difficult and to lower that threshold bit by bit. It's daunting to enter a world of seemingly full of professionals who are already skilled, who have already proven their competence. We want to show our participants that there's more than meets the eye.

There's a generosity that needs to be promoted more, we've seen that directly from the conference partners we collaborate with and the mentors giving their time to welcome people into this community. We're here to spread that message and let people know that better diversity and inclusivity in tech can happen if we organise our efforts in the right way.

And what better way to do this than to start using data well? Use data in a way that represents all of us. Use data for good, follow best practices, and educate everyone how powerful it can be in the right hands. We can all make a difference by understanding data and even more when we can work with it. Which is why we should stay humble around data.
