## Humble Data at PyData London

Learn Python for Data Science in this Beginners’ Day Workshop
Would you like to learn to code but don’t know where to start? Taking your first steps in programming can seem like an impossible task so we’ve decided to put on a workshop to show beginners how it can be done and share our passion for the world of data science!

“We want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you.” – Python Software Foundation’s Diversity Statement

We invite those from under-represented groups in data to [apply](https://forms.gle/cVyz7VJCVKm3XkHp6) to join us at PyData London (14th-16th June 2024) Humble Data Workshop. In this workshop, you will learn the basics of programming in Python, as well as how to use tools such as Jupyter Notebook to analyse data.

You will be learning in small groups, each with an assigned mentor to guide you through the workshop materials and answer your questions. This will all be facilitated online through the wonders of modern technology. You can expect plenty of exercises, quizzes and games, and inspiring talks from those who were once in your shoes.

### Calling for mentors

We wish to be able to run a workshop with as many participants as we can accommodate online, however, we also need a lot of mentors to help out. Being a mentor not only help you to familiarise yourself with your knowledge in data science, it also gives you a good vibe afterwards. If you have the skill to share, we are happy to welcome you to our Humble Data family.

Please be aware that mentors also need to be participants of the conference - PyData London. If you think you are eligible, please apply for [Diversity Scholarship](https://pydata.org/london2024/about#diversity).

### Why Humble Data?

There are many reasons for people to push aside their hopes of a tech career, we’re here to listen, to understand what makes it difficult and to lower that threshold bit by bit. It’s daunting to enter a world of seemingly full of professionals who are already skilled, who have already proven their competence. We want to show our participants that there’s more than meets the eye.

There’s a generosity that needs to be promoted more, we’ve seen that directly from the conference partners we collaborate with and the mentors giving their time to welcome people into this community. We’re here to spread that message and let people know that better diversity and inclusivity in tech can happen if we organise our efforts in the right way.

And what better way to do this than to start using data well? Use data in a way that represents all of us. Use data for good, follow best practices, and educate everyone how powerful it can be in the right hands. We can all make a difference by understanding data and even more when we can work with it. Which is why we should stay humble around data.
