## Calling for mentors

We wish to be able to run a workshop with as many participants as we can accommodate online, however, we also need a lot of mentors to help out. Be a mentor not just help you to familiarise yourself with your knowledge in data science, it also gives you a good vibe afterwards. If you have the skill to share, we are happy to welcome you to our Humble Data family. Please join using [this form](https://forms.gle/ySaCbbhpDmmtZqci7).
