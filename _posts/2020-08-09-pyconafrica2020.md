Coming up in August 2020, we have partnered with PyCon Africa to launch our 1st African workshop. We are super excited about it as the [study by GitHub on the distribution of open-source projects](https://octoverse.github.com/), there's still not as many contributors form African countries. Hopefully, we can include more folks from Africa in our Humble Data family. Note that as this workshop will be an online workshop, it is not limited to applications form Africa.

## Calling for mentors

We wish to be able to run a workshop with as many participants as we can accommodate online, however, we also need a lot of mentors to help out. Be a mentor not just help you to familiarise yourself with your knowledge in data science, it also gives you a good vibe afterwards. If you have the skill to share, we are happy to welcome you to our Humble Data family. Please join using [this form](https://t.co/MvEp7Q2Iff?amp=1).
