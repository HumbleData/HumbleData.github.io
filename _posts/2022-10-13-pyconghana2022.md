WE ARE BACK! Following the success of various remote Beginners Data Workshop at PyCon US 2020 and 2021, and successive workshops at PyCon Africa 2020 and PyData Global, we are glad to have it in person this year at PyCon Ghana 2022!

## Learn Python for Data Science in this Beginners' Day Workshop

Would you like to learn to code but don’t know where to start? Taking your first steps in programming can seem like an impossible task so we’ve decided to put on a workshop to show 30 beginners how it can be done and share our passion for the world of data science!

“We want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you.” – Python Software Foundation’s Diversity Statement

We invite those from under-represented groups in data to apply to join us on Thursday 13th October 2022 for the PyCon Ghana Beginners' Day - Humble Data Workshop. In this workshop, you will learn the basics of programming in Python, as well as how to use tools such as Jupyter Notebook to analyse data.

You will be learning in small groups, each with an assigned mentor to guide you through the workshop materials and answer your questions. This will all be facilitated online through the wonders of modern technology. You can expect plenty of exercises, quizzes and games, and inspiring talks from those who were once in your shoes.

## WHO CAN JOIN?
Anyone who registers and is selected. Although not exclusively, applicants with a PyCon Ghana Ticket will be given priority. There may be financial aid for those who cannot afford a conference ticket. Don't forget to apply when it opens.

## WHAT DO I NEED TO BRING?
You will need a computer, ideally with internet access. There may be a setup party in advance, details to be announced. Our mentors can help you set up on the day or at the setup party.

## WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW?
If you have zero programming experience, this workshop is made for you! If you already have some experience but are new to Python, we’ve got you covered too – the materials are designed for attendees to progress through the materials at their own rate.

## HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?
This workshop is being run by data scientists and software engineers dedicated to the spirit of open source. Every day we benefit from the hard work of others when we use free open tools. This is our way of giving back.

If you would like to attend this workshop, [please apply here](https://forms.gle/UMiV5QQFGMN5b6wd7). Deadline: TBC

## Mentors
We are looking for volunteers to help mentor the attendees! You don’t need to be an expert in programming, data science, or Python – we’re teaching the basics! You do need:

Lots of patience, smiles, and a friendly attitude. The ability to answer all sorts of questions in a beginner-friendly way (even if that means the explanation isn’t technically precise) throughout the duration of the workshop.

Curiosity! In return, you’ll meet interesting new people outside your usual developer group, eternal gratitude from your group of attendees, and you’ll be helping to break down stereotypes around what a developer “looks like”. Plus you can add all that to your CV!

If you would like to be a mentor, [please apply here](https://forms.gle/UMiV5QQFGMN5b6wd7).
