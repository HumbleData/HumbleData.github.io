## Workshop materials

The best way to learn is to join our workshop where you will be working in groups and there will be mentors to help. However, if you missed our event or prefer to do it on your own. All our workshop materials are open-source and is [hosted on our GitHub repo](https://github.com/HumbleData/beginners-data-workshop).

You are also welcome to organise workshops for your local community. But we have tons of experience running Humble Data workshops so the best way is to [get in touch](https://humbledata.org/pages/contact.html) and see if there's any support we can provide for you.

## Useful Resources for Online Participants

We know all these new technologies can feel a bit overwhelming sometimes, that's why we have some tutorials to help you out in using the tools that we use to facilitate our online workshops.
