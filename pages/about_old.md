## Who are we?

* We **connect** passionate mentors with eager learners. By creating a bridge between people who are already active in the tech industry with people who want to learn more about a career in tech, we enable our participants to learn much more than just how to code.
* We **encourage** people to take a step beyond what they thought was possible. By allowing previous participants to come back as mentors in our events we show how quickly you can pay it forward and keep increasing you skill levels.
* We **believe** in a world where anyone who wants to have a career in tech can. By finding the right resources, tools, community and equipment to pursue their ideal career path.

## Why Humble Data?

There are many reasons for people to push aside their hopes of a tech career, we're here to listen, understand what makes it difficult and lower that threshold bit by bit. Entering a world of people and professionals who are already skilled and have proven their competence is daunting. We want to show our participants that there's more than meets the eye.

There's a generosity that needs to be promoted more, we've seen it through the conferences we've collaborated with to the mentors who are giving their time to initiate people. We're here to spread that message and let people know that diversity and inclusivity can happen if we organise our efforts in the right way.

And what better way to do this than to start using data well. Use data in a way that represents all of us. Use data for good, following best practices and educating everyone how powerful it can be in the right hands. We can all make a difference by understanding data and even more when we can work with it. Which is why we should stay humble around data.
